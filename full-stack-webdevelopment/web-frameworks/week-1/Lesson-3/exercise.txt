Exercise: Responsive Design and Bootstrap Grid System

Objectives and Outcomes

This exercise introduces you to responsive design and Bootstrap support for mobile first responsive design through the use of the grid system. In addition we learn how to customize some of the Bootstrap classes through defining our own modifications in a separate CSS file. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

Create responsive websites using the Bootstrap grid system
Customize the CSS classes through your own additions in a separate CSS file
Note: In this exercise we will continue to update the index.html file in the conFusion folder that we created and edited in the previous lecture.

Bootstrap Grid System and Responsive Design

Bootstrap is designed to be mobile first, meaning that the classes are designed such that we can begin by targeting mobile device screens first and then work upwards to larger screen sizes. The starting point for this is first through media queries. We have already added the support for media queries in the last lecture, where we added this line to the head:

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
The viewport meta tag ensures that the screen width is set to the device width and the content is rendered with this width in mind. This brings us to the second issue, designing the websites to be responsive to the size of the viewport. This is where the Bootstrap grid system comes to our aid. Bootstrap makes available four sizes, xs for extra small, sm for small, md for medium and lg for large screen sizes. We have already seen the basics of responsive design. In this exercise, we will employ the Bootstrap grid classes to design the websites. We have already divided the content into rows. Each row in Bootstrap grid system is divided into 12 columns. We would like our website to have the content stacked on extra small devices, but become horizontal within each row for smaller devices and beyond. Towards this goal, we will make use of the classes .col-xs-*, .col-sm-*, col-md-*, and .col-lg-* for defining the layouts for the various device sizes. We can specify how many columns each piece of content will occupy within a row, all adding up to 12 or a multiple thereof.

Applying column classes within each row

In the header row, we will display the restaurant name and the description to occupy 10 columns, while we will leave two columns for displaying the restaurant logo in the future. Let us go into the jumbotron and define the classes for the inner divs as follows:
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8"> ... </div>

                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"> ... </div>
For the remaining three div rows that contain content, let us define the classes for the inner divs as follows:
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3"> ... </div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9"> ... </div>
For the footer, let us define the classes for the inner divs as follows:
            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-3"> ... </div>

            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-5"> ... </div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4"> ... </div>

            <div class="col-xs-12"> ... </div>
Now you can see how the web page has been turned into a mobile-first responsive design layout.

Using Push, Pull and Offset with column layout classes

In the content rows, we would like to have the title and description to alternate so that it gives an interesting look to the web page. For extra small screens, the default stacked layout works best. This can be accomplished by using the .col-sm-push-* and .col-sm-pull-* for the first and the third rows as follows:
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3 col-sm-push-9"> ... </div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9 col-sm-pull-3"> ... </div>
For the div containing the <ul> with the site links, update the class as follows:
                <div class="col-xs-5 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-2 col-sm-offset-1">
List styles

You can use several list styles to display lists in different formats. In this exercise, we will use the unordered list style list-unstyled to display the links at the bottom of the page without the bullets. To do this, go to the links in the footer and update the ul as follows
                    <ul class="list-unstyled"> ... </ul>
Using Custom CSS classes

We can define our own custom CSS classes in a separate CSS file, and also customize some of the built-in CSS classes. We will now attempt to do this in this part of the exercise.

Create a file named mystyles.css in the css folder. Open this file to edit the contents. Add the following CSS code to the file:
.row-header{
    margin:0px auto;
    padding:0px auto;
}

.row-content {
    margin:0px auto;
    padding: 50px 0px 50px 0px;
    border-bottom: 1px ridge;
    min-height:400px;
}

.row-footer{
    background-color: #AfAfAf;
    margin:0px auto;
    padding: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
}
Include the mystyles.css file into the head of the index.html file as follows:
    <link href="css/mystyles.css" rel="stylesheet">
Then add these classes to the corresponding rows in the index.html file as follows. See the difference in the index.html file in the browser. The first one is for the row in the <header>, the next three for the rows in the content, and the last one directly to the <footer> tag.
    <div class="row row-header"> ... </div>

    <div class="row row-content"> ... </div>

    <div class="row row-content"> ... </div>

    <div class="row row-content"> ... </div>

    <footer class="row-footer"> ... </footer>
Our last set of customization is to the jumbotron and the address. Add the following to mystyles.css file:
.jumbotron {
    padding:70px 30px 70px 30px;
    margin:0px auto;
    background: #7986CB ;
    color:floralwhite;
}

address{
    font-size:80%;
    margin:0px;
    color:#0f0f0f;
}

Now we begin to see the web page take a form closer to our final design for this module.
Conclusion

In this exercise, we reviewed responsive design and the Bootstrap grid system. We also learnt how to customize using our own CSS classes.
